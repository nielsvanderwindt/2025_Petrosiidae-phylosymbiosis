This repository is linked to the following publication:

This repository provides the files and information required for the analysis on phylosymbiosis patterns in Petrosiidae sponges. It contains a phyloseq object used for the analyses, the original code and some additional files required for some analyses. The code has been used to perform statistics (CSV output for statistics has also been included here) and provide the basis of (supplementary) figures in the published research paper. These figures were then further processed in Adobe Illustrator to provide the final figures used in publication.
